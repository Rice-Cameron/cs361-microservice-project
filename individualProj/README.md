# Cameron Rice's Individual Project - Code Saver: Code Snippet Manager

This repository folder contains the individual project of Cameron Rice named Code Saver. This is a code snippet manager in which the user can store their own code snippets that they may want to access frequently.

This includes being able to view, edit, search, tag, import, and export code snippets through CLI commands.

To run this program, run the following commands in the following order:
    - navigate to the directory of codeSaveMicroservice/
        - in one process, run "python3 codeSaverMS.py"

    - navigate to the ditrectory of individualProj/
        - in another process, run "python3 crud.py"
        - in another process, run "python3 adv_funcs.py"
        - in another process, lastly, run "python3 ui.py"

Note: It is critical that codeSaverMS.py, crud.py, and adv_funcs.py are all running 
at the same time and in different processes (terminal windows), before running ui.py in its own process.
